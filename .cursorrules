Flutter Widget Structuring Rules:

- Default to using private widget builder methods (_buildX()) inside the same file
- Do NOT extract widgets into separate files unless reuse is required
- Keep build() readable and composed of _buildX() calls
- Screen-specific UI stays in one file
- Avoid over-componentization
- Extract widgets only when they are reused or logically independent
